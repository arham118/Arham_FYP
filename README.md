# Unlocking Growth Potential: A Study on Increasing Fashion Sales at Daraz (Focused on Seller Segmentation for Improved Marketing Strategies)
### Name - Arham Nuzreth Hilal
### IIT ID - 20211246
## Overview  
This project focuses on improving Fashion sales on **Daraz**, a leading e-commerce platform in South Asia. The primary objective is to implement **machine learning-based seller segmentation** to enhance engagement, provide targeted support, and optimize marketplace performance.  

Currently, Daraz treats all sellers as a single group, which limits its ability to provide tailored assistance. By segmenting sellers based on **performance, engagement, and growth potential**, this project aims to refine marketing strategies and provide customized support to sellers at different levels.

## Objectives  
- **Classify sellers** based on their sales performance, engagement levels, and growth potential.  
- **Identify struggling sellers** and provide targeted marketing strategies to improve their performance.  
- **Support high-growth sellers** with recommendations for scaling their businesses.  
- **Improve seller retention** by offering data-driven insights and personalized support.  

## Stakeholders  
### Primary Stakeholders  
- **Daraz Seller Support Team** – Provides personalized strategies for struggling sellers.  
- **E-commerce Analysts** – Develop and implement segmentation models.  
- **Marketplace Management Team** – Uses insights to improve seller engagement strategies.  

### Secondary Stakeholders  
- **Sellers** – Benefit from tailored support and recommendations.  
- **Marketing and Sales Teams** – Use segmentation data for targeted promotional campaigns.  

## Technology and Methodology  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab  
- **Data Processing and Cleaning:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN), Decision Trees  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Source:** Seller performance data (2022–2025) from Daraz  

## Challenges and Solutions  
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Data access delays** | Maintained continuous communication with Daraz’s regional teams for approval. |
| **Project scope change** | Shifted from supermarket sales analysis to e-commerce seller segmentation, realigning methodology. |
| **Time constraints** | Developed a structured timeline with clear milestones to stay on track. |

## Work Completed  
- **Data Acquisition and Cleaning** – Collected seller performance data and processed it for analysis.  
- **Handling Missing and Duplicate Records** – Identified and cleaned inconsistent data.    

## Next Steps  
- **Develop and Train Machine Learning Models** – Implement clustering algorithms for seller segmentation.  
- **Evaluate Segmentation Results** – Analyze the effectiveness of the model and refine it if necessary.  
- **Generate Insights and Recommendations** – Provide data-driven strategies for seller engagement and sales growth.  
- **Finalize Documentation and Complete the Project Report** – Ensure all findings and methodologies are clearly documented.
